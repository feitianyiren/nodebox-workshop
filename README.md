NodeBox Workshop Materials
==========================
In the spirit of open-source, here's how the [Experimental Media Research Group](http://www.emrg.be/) give [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net/) workshops.

NodeBox workshops are typically structured as intensive 1-week classes. We typically have 10-20 students who work in small teams. 

The first two days we teach the software. The rest of the schedule the students work in small groups. We do daily evaluations with the whole group where every team can present their work to the whole class.

NOTE We're currently converting the material to NodeBox 3.

Things that work
----------------

* Every evening, we hold a [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) presentation:
  * What did you do yesterday?
  * What will you do today?
  * Do you need any help?
