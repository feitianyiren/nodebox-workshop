NodeBox Workshop Documents
==========================

In the spirit of open-source, here's how the Experimental Media Research Group give NodeBox workshops.

NodeBox workshops are typically structured as intensive 1- or 2-week classes. We typically have 10-20 students who work in small teams. 

The first two days we teach the software. The rest of the schedule the students work in small groups. We do daily evaluations with the whole group where every team can present their work to the whole class.

NOTE This is still a work in progress as we move and prepare the material.

Things that work
----------------
* We work in small groups (2-3 people). Larger groups don't perform as well.
* Every evening, we hold a presentation. 
* SCRUMM-style meetings:
  * What did you do yesterday?
  * What will you do today?
  * Do you need any help?
